"""
Grounded Sensorimotor Link Module.

This module bridges abstract regions to raw sensory and actuator data,
grounding common sense understanding in physical interaction.

Key concepts:
- Sensory grounding: "Glass is fragile" â†’ breaking force measurements
- Predictive coding: Refine regions via prediction error
- Affordances: What actions are possible with objects
- Embodied simulation: Mental models of physical interaction

Components:
- EmbodimentAdapter: Main interface between abstract and sensory
- SensorStream: Raw sensory data processing
- Actuator: Motor command generation
- PerceptualRegion: Low-level sensory regions
- PredictiveCoder: Prediction error minimization
