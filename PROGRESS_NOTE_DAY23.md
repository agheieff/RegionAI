# Day 23 Progress Note: Compositional Algorithm Discovery

## Achievement Unlocked: Creative Problem-Solving Through Composition! ðŸš€

Today we implemented one of the most significant upgrades to the system: the ability to discover algorithms by composing primitive operations. This is a massive leap toward genuine AI creativity.

## What We Built

### Breadth-First Search for Compositions
We upgraded the discovery engine from a simple loop to a proper BFS algorithm that:
1. Starts with all single primitives
2. If none work, tries all 2-step combinations
3. Finds the shortest algorithm that solves all examples
4. Can be extended to deeper searches

### Forced Compositional Discovery
By removing the SORT_DESCENDING primitive, we forced the system to be creative:
- Problem: Sort [3,1,2] â†’ [3,2,1]
- No single primitive solves this
- System discovers: SORT_ASCENDING â†’ REVERSE
- This emerges naturally from the search!

## Successful Discoveries

The system successfully discovered these compositions:

1. **SORT_DESCENDING** = SORT_ASCENDING â†’ REVERSE
   - Input: [3,1,2] â†’ Output: [3,2,1]
   - A perfect replacement for the removed primitive

2. **FIND_MAX** = SORT_ASCENDING â†’ GET_LAST
   - Input: [3,1,4,1,5] â†’ Output: [5]
   - Emerges from combining two simple operations

3. **FIND_MIN** = SORT_ASCENDING â†’ GET_FIRST
   - Input: [3,1,4,1,5] â†’ Output: [1]
   - The dual of FIND_MAX

4. **COUNT_PLUS_ONE** = COUNT â†’ ADD_ONE
   - Input: [1,2,3] â†’ Output: [4]
   - Shows arithmetic compositions work too

## The Power of Composition

With just 8 primitive operations, the system can now discover:
- Sorting algorithms (ascending, descending)
- Statistical operations (min, max, eventually median)
- Arithmetic sequences (count+1, sum+1, etc.)
- And many more we haven't even tried yet!

This is **combinatorial explosion in action** - 8 primitives give us:
- 8 single-step algorithms
- 64 two-step algorithms
- 512 three-step algorithms
- And so on...

## Technical Implementation

The key insight was implementing BFS to ensure we find the shortest solution:

```python
search_queue = deque([TransformationSequence([p]) for p in PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS])

while search_queue:
    current_sequence = search_queue.popleft()
    
    # Test if this sequence solves all problems
    if solves_all_problems(current_sequence):
        return current_sequence
    
    # If not, try extending it
    for primitive in PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS:
        new_sequence = current_sequence + [primitive]
        search_queue.append(new_sequence)
```

## Why This Matters

This is the first demonstration of **emergent problem-solving**:
1. The system faces a problem it cannot solve with existing tools
2. It systematically explores combinations of tools
3. It discovers a novel solution through composition
4. The solution generalizes to new inputs

This is fundamentally different from:
- Hard-coded algorithms
- Memorization
- Simple pattern matching

The system is now genuinely **creating new algorithms** from simpler parts.

## Next Steps

With compositional discovery working:
- Day 24: Optimize search (heuristics, pruning)
- Day 25: Discover longer sequences (3+ steps)
- Day 26: Learn to decompose problems
- Future: Recursive compositions, conditional logic

## Reflection

Today marks another fundamental milestone. We've moved from:
- Day 19: Memorization (lookup tables)
- Day 21: Single-operation discovery
- Day 23: **Multi-operation composition**

The system can now solve problems that are **more complex than any of its individual capabilities**. This is the essence of creativity - combining simple ideas in novel ways to solve new problems.
