# Week 3 Strategic Planning: Transition to N-Dimensions

## Overview
The 2D prototype has successfully demonstrated the core concepts of region-based embeddings. Now we need to generalize to N-dimensional spaces while maintaining the intuitive visualization capabilities.

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Refactor Box2D to RegionND

**Current State:**
- Box2D uses fixed 2D PyTorch tensors
- Methods assume 2D operations

**Target State:**
- RegionND accepts tensors of any dimension
- Methods work dimension-agnostically

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
class RegionND:
    def __init__(self, min_corner: torch.Tensor, max_corner: torch.Tensor):
        # Validate same dimensionality
        assert min_corner.shape == max_corner.shape
        assert min_corner.ndim == 1  # 1D tensor of N coordinates
        self.ndim = min_corner.shape[0]
        self.min_corner = min_corner
        self.max_corner = max_corner
```

### 2. Dimension-Agnostic Geometry

**Key Insight:** Most PyTorch operations are already dimension-agnostic!

**Required Changes:**
- `contains()`: Use `torch.all()` - already works for any dimension
- `overlaps()`: Use element-wise comparisons - already dimension-agnostic
- `volume()`: Use `torch.prod()` instead of manual multiplication
- `center()`: Average min/max corners - works for any dimension

### 3. The Visualization Challenge

**Problem:** Cannot directly visualize N-dimensional spaces

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: 2D Projections (Recommended for Week 3)
- Use PCA to project N-dimensional regions to 2D
- Maintain interactive features in projected space
- Show projection quality metrics

#### Option 2: Slice Visualization
- Allow user to select 2 dimensions at a time
- Show 2D slices of the N-dimensional space
- Provide dimension selector UI

#### Option 3: Parallel Coordinates
- Show each dimension as a vertical axis
- Regions become connected line segments
- Good for seeing patterns across dimensions

## Week 3 Day-by-Day Plan

### Day 13: Create RegionND
- Copy Box2D as starting point
- Generalize to N dimensions
- Ensure all tests pass with 2D, 3D, and 10D examples

### Day 14: Update ConceptSpace
- Create ConceptSpaceND
- Ensure pathfinding works in N dimensions
- Test with high-dimensional examples

### Day 15: Implement PCA Projection
- Add scikit-learn dependency
- Create projection module
- Map N-D regions to 2D for visualization

### Day 16: Update Visualization
- Modify InteractivePlotter to accept projections
- Show projection quality indicators
- Maintain all interactive features

### Day 17: Test High-Dimensional Embeddings
- Load real embedding data (if available)
- Test with 768-dim BERT embeddings
- Verify performance and accuracy

## Future Considerations

### Performance
- GPU acceleration becomes crucial in high dimensions
- Consider batch operations for multiple regions
- May need spatial indexing (R-trees) for large spaces

### Embedding Integration
- Plan for loading pre-trained embeddings
- Consider fine-tuning regions based on data
- Think about loss functions for training

### Applications
- Semantic search with hierarchical constraints
- Concept-aware text generation
- Reasoning chains through embedding space

## Success Metrics
1. RegionND works correctly for 2-1000 dimensions
2. Visualization remains interactive and intuitive
3. Pathfinding performance scales reasonably
4. Can load and visualize real embeddings

## Open Questions
1. How to handle sparse high-dimensional spaces?
2. Should we support non-box regions (spheres, ellipsoids)?
3. How to integrate with existing embedding models?
4. What's the best way to learn region boundaries from data?

## Next Steps
- Get user feedback on the 2D prototype
- Research existing work on box embeddings
- Benchmark PyTorch operations in high dimensions
- Plan data pipeline for real embeddings
