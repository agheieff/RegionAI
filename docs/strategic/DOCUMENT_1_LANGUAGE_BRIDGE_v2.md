# Document 1: The Language Bridge
## Architecture and Methodology for Natural Language to RegionAI Mapping

### Executive Summary

This document defines the architecture for bridging natural language to RegionAI's grounded functional concepts. The proposed system creates a bidirectional mapping between the ambiguity of human language and the precision of discovered computational primitives, enabling RegionAI to understand specifications, generate code, and explain its reasoning in natural terms.

### 1. Proposed Architecture

#### 1.1 Overview: The Dual-AST Approach

The core insight of our architecture is that natural language and functional computation share a fundamental property: they are both compositional. Just as complex programs decompose into primitive operations, complex utterances decompose into primitive meanings. We propose a dual-AST architecture that leverages this parallel structure.

```
Natural Language Input

[Linguistic Parser]
        ↓
Linguistic AST
        ↓
[Semantic Transformer]
        ↓
Functional AST
        ↓
[RegionAI Discovery Engine]
        ↓
Implementation
```

#### 1.2 Layer 1: Linguistic AST Construction

The Linguistic AST represents the grammatical and semantic structure of natural language input. Unlike traditional parse trees that focus on syntax, our Linguistic AST captures semantic intent.

**Example:**
Input: "Calculate the average score for each student"

```
LinguisticAST(
  action: Calculate(
    target: Average(
      of: Score
    ),
    grouping: ForEach(
      entity: Student
    )
  )
)
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Action Nodes**: Represent verbs and their intent (Calculate, Find, Create, Transform)
2. **Entity Nodes**: Represent nouns and data structures (Student, Score, List)
3. **Modifier Nodes**: Represent adjectives and constraints (Average, Maximum, Positive)
4. **Relation Nodes**: Represent prepositions and relationships (ForEach, Of, With)

#### 1.3 Layer 2: Semantic Transformation

The Semantic Transformer maps Linguistic AST nodes to Functional AST nodes using learned correspondences. This is where ambiguity resolution occurs.

**Transformation Rules (Examples):**

```
Calculate(Average(X)) → REDUCE(X, MEAN)
ForEach(Entity) → GROUP_BY(Entity.id)
Find(Maximum(X)) → REDUCE(X, MAX)
Filter(Positive(X)) → FILTER(X, GREATER_THAN(0))
```

**Key Innovation: Contextual Region Embeddings**

Each linguistic concept maps to a region in the same high-dimensional space as RegionAI's functional primitives. The transformation process finds the nearest functional regions to linguistic regions.

```python
class SemanticTransformer:
    def __init__(self, linguistic_embeddings, functional_embeddings):
        self.ling_space = linguistic_embeddings
        self.func_space = functional_embeddings
        self.alignment = self.learn_alignment()
    
    def transform(self, linguistic_ast):
        # Map each linguistic node to functional space
        functional_nodes = []
        for node in linguistic_ast.traverse():
            ling_region = self.ling_space.encode(node)
            func_region = self.alignment.project(ling_region)
            functional_primitive = self.func_space.nearest(func_region)
            functional_nodes.append(functional_primitive)
        
        # Compose functional AST maintaining structure
        return self.compose_functional_ast(functional_nodes)
```

#### 1.4 Layer 3: Functional AST Generation

The Functional AST uses RegionAI's discovered primitives as nodes. This is the executable representation.

**Example Transformation:**
```
Linguistic: Calculate(Average(Score), ForEach(Student))
                            ↓
Functional: COMPOSE(
  GROUP_BY('student_id'),
  MAP(
    COMPOSE(
      MAP_GET('score'),
      REDUCE(MEAN)
    )
  )
)
```

#### 1.5 Ambiguity Resolution Through Region Overlap

When linguistic regions map to multiple functional regions, we use several strategies:

1. **Context Expansion**: Include surrounding linguistic context to narrow the functional mapping
2. **Type Constraints**: Use inferred types to eliminate incompatible mappings
3. **Precedence Learning**: Learn from training data which mappings are most common
4. **Interactive Clarification**: When confidence is low, generate clarifying questions

#### 1.6 Bidirectional Flow: Explanation Generation

The architecture supports reverse transformation for explanation:

```
Functional AST → Linguistic AST → Natural Language
```

This enables RegionAI to explain discovered patterns in human terms.
