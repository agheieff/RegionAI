# Document 4: The Roadmap to Common Sense
## Extending RegionAI from Code Logic to Real-World Understanding

### Executive Summary

This document explores the theoretical pathway from RegionAI's current foundation in formal computation to a system capable of common-sense reasoning about the physical and social world. We propose that the same region-based architecture that discovers code transformations can be extended to discover the implicit rules governing everyday reality. This is not merely an engineering challenge but a fundamental exploration of how intelligence bridges the gap between logic and intuition.

### 1. Defining the Primitives of Reality

#### 1.1 The Fundamental Challenge

Unlike code primitives which are discrete and deterministic (ADD, FILTER, MAP), the primitives of common sense are continuous, probabilistic, and context-dependent. A chair is furniture in a living room but becomes a weapon in a bar fight, a ladder when reaching high shelves, or a barricade during an emergency. Our challenge is to identify the fundamental conceptual atoms from which such fluid understanding emerges.

#### 1.2 Proposed Primitive Categories

##### 1.2.1 Physical Reality and Causation

These primitives encode our understanding of how the physical world operates:

**Object Permanence and Continuity**:
- `ContinuesExisting(Object, TimeInterval)`: Objects persist when unobserved
- `OccupiesSpace(Object, Region3D)`: Objects have spatial extent
- `IsSolid(Object)` / `IsFluid(Object)` / `IsGas(Object)`: Matter states
- `CanPassThrough(Object1, Object2)`: Permeability relationships

**Spatial Relationships**:
- `IsInside(A, B)`: Containment (with fuzzy boundaries)
- `IsTouching(A, B)`: Contact relationships
- `IsAbove/Below/NextTo(A, B)`: Relative positioning
- `CanReach(Agent, Object, Context)`: Accessibility given constraints

**Causal Mechanics**:
- `Causes(Event1, Event2, Probability)`: Probabilistic causation
- `Prevents(Condition, Event)`: Blocking relationships
- `Enables(Condition, Event)`: Necessary but not sufficient conditions
- `WillResultIn(Action, StateChange, Context)`: Predictive causation

**Physical Properties**:
- `HasMass(Object, Range)`: Weight affects behavior
- `IsFragile(Object)` / `IsDurable(Object)`: Resistance to damage
- `CanSupport(Object, Weight)`: Structural capacity
- `WillFall(Object, Context)`: Gravity effects

**Example Compositions**:
```
IsFragile(Glass) ∧ WillFall(Glass, FromHeight) 
    → WillResultIn(Fall, Broken(Glass), 0.95)

IsSolid(Door) ∧ ¬CanPassThrough(Person, Door) ∧ CanOpen(Door)
    → Enables(Open(Door), PassThrough(Person, DoorFrame))
```

##### 1.2.2 Agents, Intentions, and Capabilities

These primitives model entities with goals and the ability to act:

**Agency and Autonomy**:
- `IsAgent(Entity)`: Can initiate actions
- `HasGoal(Agent, State)`: Desired end states
- `Believes(Agent, Proposition)`: Mental models (possibly incorrect)
- `Knows(Agent, Fact)`: Verified beliefs
- `CanPerceive(Agent, Object, Context)`: Sensory capabilities

**Capabilities and Constraints**:
- `CanPerform(Agent, Action, Context)`: Physical/skill capabilities
- `HasResource(Agent, Resource, Amount)`: Available means
- `RequiresFor(Action, Resource)`: Action prerequisites
- `WillAttempt(Agent, Action, Probability)`: Behavioral prediction

**Mental States**:
- `Wants(Agent, Object/State)`: Desires
- `Fears(Agent, Event/State)`: Aversions
- `Expects(Agent, Event, Probability)`: Predictions
- `Remembers(Agent, Event)`: Historical knowledge

**Planning and Reasoning**:
- `IsAwareThat(Agent, Fact)`: Conscious knowledge
- `CanInfer(Agent, Fact1, Fact2)`: Reasoning capability
- `WillChoose(Agent, Options, Context)`: Decision making
- `LearnsFrom(Agent, Experience)`: Adaptation

**Example Compositions**:
```
HasGoal(Child, HasObject(Cookie)) ∧ 
IsInside(Cookie, Jar) ∧ 
IsAbove(Jar, ReachHeight(Child)) ∧
CanSupport(Chair, Weight(Child))
    → WillAttempt(Child, MoveObject(Chair, NearTo(Jar)), 0.8)

Believes(PersonA, IsTrue(X)) ∧ 
Knows(PersonB, IsFalse(X)) ∧
IsFriendsWith(PersonA, PersonB)
    → WillAttempt(PersonB, Correct(PersonA), 0.6)
```

##### 1.2.3 Social Dynamics and Norms

These primitives capture the implicit rules of human interaction:

**Social Relationships**:
- `HasRelationship(Agent1, Agent2, Type)`: Family, friend, stranger, enemy
- `IsSociallyResponsibleFor(Agent1, Agent2)`: Duty of care
- `TrustsRegarding(Agent1, Agent2, Domain)`: Domain-specific trust
- `HasAuthorityOver(Agent1, Agent2, Context)`: Power dynamics

**Social Obligations**:
- `IsObligatedTo(Agent, Action, Context)`: Social duties
- `IsProhibitedFrom(Agent, Action, Context)`: Social restrictions
- `IsExpectedTo(Agent, Behavior, SocialGroup)`: Norms
- `ViolatesNorm(Action, Norm, Severity)`: Transgression detection

**Communication and Information**:
- `IntendsToCommunicate(Speaker, Message, Listener)`: Speech acts
- `ImpliesButNotStates(Utterance, Meaning)`: Implicature
- `IsPoliteFormOf(Expression1, Expression2)`: Social register
- `WouldOffend(Statement, Listener, Context)`: Social prediction

**Cooperation and Competition**:
- `SharesGoalWith(Agent1, Agent2, Goal)`: Alignment
- `CompetesFor(Agent1, Agent2, Resource)`: Conflict
- `WillCooperate(Agent1, Agent2, Task, Probability)`: Collaboration prediction
- `OwesTo(Agent1, Agent2, Obligation)`: Social debt

**Example Compositions**:
```
HasAuthorityOver(Parent, Child, DomesticContext) ∧
IsObligatedTo(Parent, Protect(Child), Always) ∧
WillResultIn(Action, Harm(Child), HighProbability)
    → IsProhibitedFrom(Parent, Action, LegalContext)

IsExpectedTo(Guest, Express(Gratitude), AfterReceiving(Gift)) ∧
¬Performs(Guest, Express(Gratitude), ReasonableTime)
    → ViolatesNorm(Behavior(Guest), Politeness, Minor) ∧
       WillResultIn(Violation, Decrease(SocialStanding(Guest)), 0.7)
```

##### 1.2.4 Temporal Dynamics and Change

These primitives model how situations evolve over time:

**Temporal Relationships**:
- `HappensBefore(Event1, Event2)`: Sequencing
- `HappensDuring(Event1, Interval)`: Temporal containment
- `WillOccurWithin(Event, TimeRange, Probability)`: Future prediction
- `RecursEvery(Event, Period)`: Cyclic patterns

**State Changes**:
- `TransitionsFrom(State1, State2, Trigger)`: State machines
- `IsPermanent(Change)` / `IsReversible(Change)`: Change properties
- `AccumulatesOverTime(Property, Rate)`: Gradual changes
- `HasThreshold(Process, Value, Result)`: Tipping points

**Persistence and Memory**:
- `RemainsTrue(Fact, Duration)`: Fact persistence
- `Decays(Property, Rate)`: Degradation
- `RequiresMaintenance(State, Frequency)`: Upkeep needs
- `LeavesTrace(Event, Evidence)`: Historical markers

##### 1.2.5 Abstract and Evaluative Concepts

These higher-order primitives enable judgment and categorization:

**Value and Utility**:
- `HasValue(Object/State, Agent, Amount)`: Subjective worth
- `IsGoodFor(Event/State, Agent)` / `IsBadFor(Event/State, Agent)`: Benefit/harm
- `PreferredOver(Option1, Option2, Agent, Context)`: Preferences
- `OptimizesFor(Agent, Criterion)`: Decision drivers

**Categories and Prototypes**:
- `IsKindOf(Instance, Category, Degree)`: Fuzzy membership
- `IsTypicalOf(Instance, Category)`: Prototypicality
- `SharesFeaturesWith(A, B, Features)`: Similarity
- `ServesSamePurposeAs(Object1, Object2, Context)`: Functional equivalence

**Risk and Uncertainty**:
- `IsSafeFor(Action, Agent, Context)`: Safety assessment
- `HasRisk(Action, Consequence, Probability)`: Risk evaluation
- `IsWorthRisk(Action, Benefit, Risk, Agent)`: Risk/reward analysis
- `IncreasesProbabilityOf(Factor, Outcome)`: Influence relationships

#### 1.3 Compositional Richness

The true power of these primitives emerges through composition. Consider this everyday scenario decomposed into primitive operations:

**Scenario**: "A mother notices her toddler reaching for a hot stove"

```
Perceives(Mother, Reaching(Toddler, Stove)) ∧
Knows(Mother, IsHot(Stove)) ∧
Knows(Mother, WillResultIn(Touch(Toddler, HotObject), Burn(Toddler), 0.95)) ∧
HasGoal(Mother, ¬Harm(Toddler)) ∧
IsSociallyResponsibleFor(Mother, Toddler) ∧
CanPerform(Mother, QuicklyGrab(Toddler), CurrentContext)
    → WillAttempt(Mother, PreventTouch(Toddler, Stove), 0.99)
```

This single second of human behavior requires understanding:
- Physical causation (hot objects burn)
- Agent capabilities (toddler can reach, mother can intervene)
- Social relationships (parental responsibility)
- Goal inference (mother wants child safe)
- Temporal urgency (must act before contact)
- Action selection (grab child vs. move stove vs. verbal warning)

#### 1.4 Learning vs. Encoding

A critical question: which primitives are discovered versus built-in? We propose a hybrid approach:

**Likely Innate** (hard-coded or quickly learned):
- Basic physics: ObjectPermanence, Gravity effects
- Core agency: IsAgent, HasGoal
- Fundamental causation: Causes, Prevents

**Definitely Learned** (discovered through experience):
- Social norms: IsPoliteFormOf, ViolatesNorm
- Specific capabilities: CanPerform(Human, SwimButterfly)
- Cultural concepts: HasAuthorityOver(context-specific)

**Emergent Compositions** (arise from primitive combination):
- Complex reasoning: "If someone looks repeatedly at their watch during conversation, they want to leave"
- Social scripts: "At restaurants, you order, eat, then pay"
- Contextual categories: "A tree stump is a chair in the forest"

#### 1.5 Representation in RegionAI

These common-sense primitives map naturally to RegionAI's architecture:

**Region Properties**:
- **Size**: Represents concept generality (FURNITURE is larger than CHAIR)
- **Overlap**: Captures partial membership (TOMATO overlaps FRUIT and VEGETABLE)
- **Distance**: Encodes similarity (COUCH near SOFA, far from DESK)
- **Containment**: Shows hierarchies (DOG within MAMMAL within ANIMAL)

**Fuzzy Boundaries**:
Unlike code transformations with crisp definitions, common-sense regions have soft boundaries:
```
Membership(Penguin, Bird) = 0.95  // Definitely a bird
Membership(Penguin, FlyingThing) = 0.05  // But can't fly
Membership(Bat, Bird) = 0.15  // Not a bird but flies
Membership(Ostrich, TypicalBird) = 0.3  // Atypical bird
```

**Context-Dependent Deformation**:
Regions can stretch or contract based on context:
```
InContext(Emergency):
    Expands(TOOL, ToInclude(CHAIR))  // Chair becomes tool for breaking window
    Expands(WEAPON, ToInclude(PENCIL))  // Pencil becomes defensive weapon
    
InContext(FormalDinner):
    Contracts(ACCEPTABLE_CLOTHING, ToExclude(JEANS))
    Contracts(APPROPRIATE_TOPICS, ToExclude(POLITICS))
```

### Next Steps

Having defined the primitive building blocks of common-sense reasoning, Section 2 will design a curriculum for teaching these concepts through grounded scenarios. Section 3 will then explore how RegionAI's architecture can represent the fluid boundary between logic and intuition that characterizes human understanding.
