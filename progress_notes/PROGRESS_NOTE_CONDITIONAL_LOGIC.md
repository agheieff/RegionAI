# Progress Note: Conditional Control Flow Implementation

## Date: 2025-01-09

## Summary
Successfully implemented conditional control flow in RegionAI, enabling the discovery of algorithms with if/else logic. The system can now learn to apply different transformations based on conditions, such as "give engineers a 10% raise, everyone else 3%."

## Key Achievements

### 1. Boolean Primitives

**HAS_KEY**
- Checks if a dictionary contains a specific key
- Returns boolean value for conditional evaluation
- Type: `dict -> boolean`

**VALUE_EQUALS**
- Checks if a dictionary's value for a key equals a specific value
- Enables field-based conditional logic
- Type: `dict -> boolean`
- Example: `VALUE_EQUALS(item, 'role', 'engineer')` returns True/False

### 2. Arithmetic and Update Primitives

**MULTIPLY**
- Multiplies tensor values by a scalar
- Enables percentage-based calculations
- Type: `vector -> vector`

**UPDATE_FIELD**
- Updates a field in dictionaries with new value or function
- Critical for in-place data transformation
- Type: `dict_list -> dict_list`
- Supports both static values and update functions

### 3. ConditionalTransformation Architecture

**New Dataclass**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ConditionalTransformation:
    condition: AppliedTransformation  # Boolean-producing
    if_true_sequence: TransformationSequence
    if_false_sequence: TransformationSequence
```

**Key Features**
- Evaluates condition for each data item
- Executes appropriate branch based on result
- Maintains data structure throughout transformation
- Clean representation: `IF(condition) THEN ... ELSE ...`

### 4. Hierarchical Discovery Engine

**Conditional Pattern Detection**
- Analyzes input/output pairs to identify conditional patterns
- Detects when different groups receive different treatments
- Automatically identifies the discriminating field (e.g., 'role')

**Multiplier Inference**
- Calculates transformation ratios from examples
- Groups by condition field to find patterns
- Identifies special cases vs. default behavior

**Automatic Branch Construction**
- Builds appropriate true/false branches
- Creates UPDATE_FIELD operations with correct multipliers
- Tests complete conditional structure against all problems

### 5. Successful Test Results

The system discovered:
```
IF VALUE_EQUALS('role', 'engineer') 
THEN UPDATE_FIELD('salary', x * 1.1)
ELSE UPDATE_FIELD('salary', x * 1.03)
```

Test outcomes:
- ✓ Correctly applied 10% raise to engineers
- ✓ Correctly applied 3% raise to non-engineers
- ✓ Handled all-engineers case
- ✓ Handled no-engineers case
- ✓ Generalized to new data

## Technical Implementation

### Discovery Algorithm
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Examines salary changes grouped by role
2. **Multiplier Detection**: Identifies consistent multipliers per role
3. **Condition Inference**: Determines discriminating field and value
4. **Branch Construction**: Builds true/false transformation sequences
5. **Validation**: Tests complete conditional against all problems

### Example Execution Flow
```
Input: {'role': 'engineer', 'salary': 100000}
Condition: VALUE_EQUALS('role', 'engineer') -> True
Branch: if_true_sequence
Action: UPDATE_FIELD('salary', x * 1.1)
Output: {'role': 'engineer', 'salary': 110000}
```

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Higher-Order Operations**: Implemented transformations that take other transformations as arguments
2. **Pattern Detection**: Created heuristics to identify conditional patterns from examples
3. **Branch Construction**: Automatically built appropriate transformation sequences for each branch
4. **Type Safety**: Maintained type checking through conditional branches

## Architectural Impact

This implementation represents a quantum leap in RegionAI's capabilities:

1. **From Linear to Branching**: Algorithms can now have multiple execution paths
2. **Context-Aware Processing**: Different data receives different treatment based on properties
3. **Closer to Real Code**: If/else structures are fundamental to programming
4. **Exponentially Larger Solution Space**: Can now discover vastly more complex algorithms

## Next Steps

This foundation enables:
1. Nested conditionals (if/else if/else chains)
2. Multiple condition evaluation (AND/OR logic)
3. More complex boolean expressions
4. Switch-case style branching
5. Conditional loops and iterations

## Files Created/Modified
- `transformation.py`: Added ConditionalTransformation class and new primitives
- `discover_conditional.py`: Hierarchical discovery engine for branching logic
- `conditional_bonus_curriculum.py`: Test cases for conditional transformations

## Impact
RegionAI can now discover algorithms that make decisions, a fundamental requirement for understanding and generating real programming logic. This moves the system significantly closer to discovering complex, practical algorithms that appear in actual code.
