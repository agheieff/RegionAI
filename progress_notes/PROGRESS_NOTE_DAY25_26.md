# Day 25-26 Progress Note: Deep Compositional Discovery with Filtering

## Achievement Unlocked: Complex Data Processing Algorithms! 🔍

Today we introduced a powerful new primitive (FILTER_GT_5) and demonstrated that the system can discover sophisticated multi-step algorithms for selective data processing.

## What We Built

### New Filtering Primitive
We added `FILTER_GT_5` which selects elements greater than 5:
- Input: `[1, 6, 3, 10, 4]` 
- Output: `[6, 10]`

This is fundamentally different from our previous primitives because it:
- Selects based on **value**, not position
- Returns a variable-length output
- Enables conditional processing

### Deeper Search Capability
We increased `MAX_SEARCH_DEPTH` from 2 to 3, allowing discovery of more complex algorithms. The search space grew from 81 to 819 possible sequences!

## Successful Discoveries

The system discovered these powerful compositions:

1. **SUM_OF_LARGE** = FILTER_GT_5 → SUM
   - "Sum all elements greater than 5"
   - Example: `[3,8,2,10]` → `18` (sum of 8 and 10)
   - Shows selective aggregation

2. **COUNT_LARGE** = FILTER_GT_5 → COUNT
   - "Count how many elements are greater than 5"
   - Example: `[1,6,2,8,3]` → `2`
   - Shows conditional counting

3. **Handled Edge Cases**
   - Empty filter results: `[1,2,3,4]` → `0` (nothing > 5)
   - Boundary values: `[5,5,5]` → `0` (not greater than 5)
   - Single elements: `[10]` → `10`

## Why This Is Significant

### Real-World Applications
These algorithms are building blocks for:
- **Data Analysis**: "Sum all sales above threshold"
- **Statistics**: "Average of outliers"
- **Machine Learning**: "Count features above cutoff"
- **Signal Processing**: "Sum peaks above noise floor"

### Emergent Complexity
From just 9 primitives, the system can now discover algorithms that:
1. Filter data conditionally
2. Process the filtered subset
3. Return meaningful aggregations

This mirrors how human programmers combine simple operations to solve complex problems.

## Technical Insights

### Search Process
The BFS systematically explored:
- **Depth 1**: No single primitive works
- **Depth 2**: Found FILTER_GT_5 → SUM
- The system avoided invalid combinations and found the shortest solution

### Computational Challenge
With 9 primitives and depth 3:
- Total search space: 819 sequences
- BFS guarantees optimal solution
- But exponential growth demands future optimizations

## Limitations Discovered

1. **Fixed Threshold**: FILTER_GT_5 has hardcoded value (5)
   - Future: Parameterized operations
   
2. **Missing Operations**: 
   - No division (for averages)
   - No parameterized filters
   - No conditional branching

3. **Search Efficiency**:
   - Brute force becomes expensive
   - Need heuristics and pruning

## Next Steps

With filtering and deep search working:
- Day 27: Parameterized operations
- Day 28: Search optimization (heuristics, pruning)
- Day 29: Learning operation sequences from natural language
- Future: Conditional logic, loops, recursion

## Reflection

Today's work represents another fundamental advance. We've moved from:
- Simple transformations (REVERSE, SORT)
- To compositional algorithms (SORT → REVERSE)
- To **selective processing** (FILTER → AGGREGATE)

The system can now discover algorithms that don't just rearrange or transform data uniformly, but that **intelligently select and process** subsets based on criteria. This is approaching the kind of data manipulation that real-world programming requires.

The combination of filtering + aggregation opens up a vast space of useful algorithms. The system is beginning to discover patterns that would be genuinely useful in production code.

*From primitives to algorithms, from algorithms to intelligent data processing - the journey continues.*
